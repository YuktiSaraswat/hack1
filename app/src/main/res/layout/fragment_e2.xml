Repair deep plaster cracks in ceilings and foundations. Get expert advice if there are signs of structural defects.
\nAnchor overhead lighting fixtures to the ceiling.
\nFollow BIS codes relevant to your area for building standards
\nFasten shelves securely to walls.
\nPlace large or heavy objects on lower shelves.
\nStore breakable items such as bottled foods, glass, and china in low, closed cabinets with latches.
\nHang heavy items such as pictures and mirrors away from beds, settees, and anywhere that people sit.
\nBrace overhead light and fan fixtures.
\nRepair defective electrical wiring and leaky gas connections. These are potential fire risks.
\nSecure water heaters, LPG cylinders etc., by strapping them to the walls or bolting to the floor.
\nStore weed killers, pesticides, and flammable products securely in closed cabinets with latches and on bottom shelves.
\nIdentify safe places indoors and outdoors.
\nUnder strong dining table, bed
\nAgainst an inside wall
\nAway from where glass could shatter around windows, mirrors, pictures, or where heavy bookcases or other heavy furniture could fall over
\nIn the open, away from buildings, trees, telephone and electrical lines, flyovers and bridges
\nKnow emergency telephone numbers (such as those of doctors, hospitals, the police, etc)
\nEducate yourself and family members
\nAwareness Generation Resources for Earthquake Diasaster Management
\nDisaster(Earthquake) Resistant Construction Practice
\nTechno Legal Regime for Safe Construction Practice (Model Amendment in Town and Country Planning Legislations, Regulation for Land Use Zoning and Building Byelaws for Structural Safety)
\nPast Programmes/Projects, Resource Materials on Earthquake Risk Management.
\nHave a disaster emergency kit ready
\nBattery operated torch with extra batteries
\nBattery operated radio
\nFirst aid kit and manual
\nEmergency food (dry items) and water (packed and sealed)
\nCandles and matches in a waterproof container
\nKnife
\nChlorine tablets or powdered water purifiers
\nCan opener.
\nEssential medicines
\nCash and credit cards
\nThick ropes and cords
\nSturdy shoes
\nDevelop an emergency communication plan
\nIn case family members are separated from one another during an earthquake (a real possibility during the day when adults are at work and children are at school), develop a plan for reuniting after the disaster.
\nAsk an out-of-state relative or friend to serve as the 'family contact' after the disaster; it is often easier to call long distance. Make sure everyone in the family knows the name, address, and phone number of the contact person.
\nHelp your community get ready
\nPublish a special section in your local newspaper with emergency information on earthquakes. Localize the information by printing the phone numbers of local emergency services offices and hospitals.
\nConduct week-long series on locating hazards in the home.
\nWork with local emergency services and officials to prepare special reports for people with mobility impairment on what to do during an earthquake.
\nProvide tips on conducting earthquake drills in the home.
\nInterview representatives of the gas, electric, and water companies about shutting off utilities.
\nWork together in your community to apply your knowledge to building codes, retrofitting programmes, hazard hunts, and neighborhood and family emergency plans.

\nDROP to the ground; take COVER by getting under a sturdy table or other piece of furniture; and HOLD ON until the shaking stops. If there is no a table or desk near you, cover your face and head with your arms and crouch in an inside corner of the building.
\nProtect yourself by staying under the lintel of an inner door, in the corner of a room, under a table or even under a bed.
\nStay away from glass, windows, outside doors and walls, and anything that could fall, (such as lighting fixtures or furniture).
\nStay in bed if you are there when the earthquake strikes. Hold on and protect your head with a pillow, unless you are under a heavy light fixture that could fall. In that case, move to the nearest safe place.
\nUse a doorway for shelter only if it is in close proximity to you and if you know it is a strongly supported, load bearing doorway.
\nStay inside until the shaking stops and it is safe to go outside. Research has shown that most injuries occur when people inside buildings attempt to move to a different location inside the building or try to leave.
\nBe aware that the electricity may go out or the sprinkler systems or fire alarms may turn on.
\n\nIf outdoors:
\nDo not move from where you are. However, move away from buildings, trees, streetlights, and utility wires.
\nIf you are in open space, stay there until the shaking stops. The greatest danger exists directly outside buildings; at exits; and alongside exterior walls. Most earthquake-related casualties result from collapsing walls, flying glass, and falling objects.
\n\nIf in a moving vehicle:
\nStop as quickly as safety permits and stay in the vehicle. Avoid stopping near or under buildings, trees, overpasses, and utility wires.
\nProceed cautiously once the earthquake has stopped. Avoid roads, bridges, or ramps that might have been damaged by the earthquake.
\nIf trapped under debris:
\nDo not light a match.
\nDo not move about or kick up dust.
\nCover your mouth with a handkerchief or clothing.
\nTap on a pipe or wall so rescuers can locate you. Use a whistle if one is available. Shout only as a last resort. Shouting can cause you to inhale dangerous amounts of dust. "/>
